# Monthly Salary Calculator

## Description

Created a form that a user can enter in the employee's name, id, job title, and annual salary. When the "Submit" button is clicked it will add the employee to the table and calculate how much their monthly salary is. If the total monthly salary goes over \$20,000 it will highlight in red. The user can delete any employee entry they have made and the monthly salary will update as needed.
